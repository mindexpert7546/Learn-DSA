/**
 * Harshad number or not using Java :
 * Harshad number is a number or an integer in base 10 which is completely divisible by sum of  its digits.
 *
 * For better understanding let us consider an example.
 *
 * Example :
 *
 * Suppose a number 24 .
 * Calculate the sum of digits of the number (2 + 4) = 6 .
 * Check whether the number entered by user is completely divisible by sum of its digits or not.
 * Below are first few Harshad Numbers represented in base 10 :
 *
 * 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 20â€¦â€¦â€¦
 *
 * In this article, we will create a java program to check whether the number entered by the user is Harshad number or not.
